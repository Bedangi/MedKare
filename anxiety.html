    <h2>SINHA’S COMPREHENSIVE ANXIETY TEST</h2>

    <p>Sinha's Comprehensive Anxiety Test (SCAT) is a psychological test designed to assess the severity of anxiety in individuals. 
    It is a widely used tool in both clinical and research settings.
        <ul> 
            <li><u>What it measures:</u> The SCAT measures generalized anxiety, which is characterized by excessive and persistent worry about a variety of things, as well as specific anxieties, such as social anxiety, phobias, and panic disorder.</li>	
        
            <li><U>How it works:</U> The SCAT is a self-report questionnaire that consists of 40 items. Each item describes a symptom of anxiety, and respondents’ rate how much they experience that symptom on a scale of 0 (not at all) to 4 (very much).</li>
            
            <li><u>Scoring:</u> The scores are summed up to provide a total score, which can then be interpreted to determine the severity of the individual's anxiety.</li>
            
            <li><u>Administration:</u> The SCAT can be administered individually or in a group setting. It typically takes about 15-20 minutes to complete.</li>
