        <h1>PSYCHOMETRIC TEST</h1>
        <p>
            A psychometric test is a standardized and scientific way to measure various aspects of an individual, typically their cognitive abilities and personality traits.

        </p>
    <br>
    <p>There are two main types of psychometric tests:
    <ul><li>APTITUDE TEST:</li> These assess your cognitive abilities, such as problem-solving, critical thinking,   numerical    reasoning, verbal reasoning, and spatial reasoning. Examples include tests like numerical reasoning assessments that might ask you to interpret data and make calculations, or logical reasoning tests that present scenarios and require you to identify the next logical step.
        <li>PERSONALITY TEST</li>	 These focus on your behavioural preferences, emotions, motivations, and overall personality. Examples include tests like the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) which categorizes individuals based on their preferences for extraversion/introversion, sensing/intuition     thinking/feeling, and judging/perceiving.
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p>Here we will focus on <u>HOWARD GARDENER’S THEORY OF INTELLIGENCE</u></p>

    <h2 style="font-size: 40px;">HOWARD GARDENER’S THEORY OF INTELLIGENCE:</h2>
    <BR>
    <p>Howard Gardner's theory of multiple intelligences suggests that intelligence is not a single, fixed attribute but rather a collection of distinct abilities or intelligences, each of which may be more or less developed in an individual. Gardner proposed eight different intelligences:
    <br>

     <ol type="1">
        <li>LINGUISTIC INTELLIGENCE: sensitivity to spoken and written language, and the ability to learn languages.</li>	 
        <li>LOGICAL-MATHEMATICAL INTELLIGENCE: capacity for logical reasoning and mathematical problem-solving. </li>	 
        <li>SPATIAL INTELLIGENCE: ability to think in three dimensions and visualize spatial relationships.</li>	
        <li>MUSICAL INTELLIGENCE: skill in performing, composing, and appreciating music.</li>	 
        <li>BODILY-KINESTHETICS: ability to control body movements and handle objects skilfully.</li>	
        <li>INTERPERSONAL INTELLIGENCE: understanding and interacting effectively with others. </li>	
        <li>INTRAPERSONAL INTELLIGENCE: understanding one's own emotions, motivations, and goals.</li>	 
        <li>NATURALISTIC INTELLIGENCE: sensitivity to and appreciation of the natural world.</li>	
        </ol>
        <br>
        
        <p>However, there isn't a standardized test specifically designed by Howard Gardner to measure these intelligences. Instead, educators and psychologists have developed various assessments and tools inspired by Gardner's theory to help individuals identify their strengths and preferences.</p>
