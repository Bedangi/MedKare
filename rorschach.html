  <h1>RORSCHACH INKBLOT TEST</h1>
  

  <body>
    <div class="description">  <p>Rorschach inkblot test is a projective psychological test in which subjects' perceptions of inkblots are recorded and then analysed using psychological interpretation, complex algorithms or both. Some psychologists use this test to examine a person's personality characteristics and emotional functioning. It has been employed to detect underlying thought disorder, especially in cases where patients are reluctant to describe their thinking processes openly.

      The test consists of 10 inkblots, some black and white and some coloured. The inkblots are shown to the subject one at a time, and they are asked to say what they see in each inkblot. The examiner then scores the responses based on a number of factors, including the location of the percept (e g., whole blot, detail), the type of percept (eg, human, animal, object), and the originality of the percept
      
      Our vision is to provide fair, unbiased, accurate, and useful professional, scientific and objective information to students, professionals, and lay persons regarding the Rorschach Inkblot Test.</p>
